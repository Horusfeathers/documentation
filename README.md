# documentation
 
This document is a tutorial that wants to offer Java developers all the needed information to build a complete blockchain application on the Horizen sidechain system.
Apart from Java competency, this tutorial assumes that the reader has at least a high level understanding of how blockchain-based distributed software works. 
So, concepts such as Transactions, UTXO, Blocks, Validation, Confirmation, Consensus, Unique chain and chain forks, Hash Function, Private/Public key and Signature, … should be known and understood, as well as the concept of network of nodes and node communication. If the above words are new to you, you can start by exploring the material available on the Horizen Academy web site. Also, the original whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto, “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” can be a good starting point. 
Direct experience with an existing blockchain software is also a very useful prerequisite. For that, you can install the Horizen “zend” software, and explore its rpc command interface and “regtest” mode.
