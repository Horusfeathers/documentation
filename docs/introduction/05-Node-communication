Node communication
==================

Communication  between user and a sidechain node is supported out of the box via HTTP POST requests API methods. Custom applications could extend them to add new, remove existing and and/or replace core behaviours.

The API configuration could be found in a sidechain configuration file. For example, in examples/simpleapp/src/main/resources/sc_settings.conf you can find in the restApi section the one for the SimpleApp sidechain. 
The available options are:

bindAddress -- “IP:port” address for sending HTTP request,e.g. "127.0.0.1:9085"

api-key-hash -- Authentication header must be a string that hashes to the field "api-key-hash" specified in each SC node conf file. Auth header could be empty If no api-key-hash is specified

timeout -- Timeout on API requests in seconds

There are many ways to send API requests to a Sidechain node (in fact any REST client could be used):
  * Embedded swagger client: Sending HTTP requests via a  swagger client which is already embedded in the Sidechain Node. So you could run in your browser “IP:port” as defined in your configuration file, and select any of the commands shown there. For example:
